# ledger server

This server is simple and has one purpose, grab the latest Nano ledger file and provide it as an API for download.

Credit goes to mynano.ninja for providing the idea and the source code.

I wanted to create this server so the api is available internally without needing to run the full source code or depend on 3rd party servers

# install
1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`
